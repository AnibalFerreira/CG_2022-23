# CG 2022/2023 - Project

## Observations

- When starting the server the camera will start close to the center of the terrain and very high up. However, in the GUI there is a checkbox titled `Close Up Camera` which when checked will have the camera following the bird from behind at a fixed distance. At this point, the checkbox can be unselected and the camera will remain in the last position it was and the user has full control again, being able to zoom in or out and move around to be able to better view whatever he chooses.
- For section 7 of the script, we chose the point A where we added a free fall for the egg with improved animation and physics (these will imitate the fall of an object with or without horizontal velocity, according to the acceleration of gravity on Earth, rounded to 9.8, with 0 wind resistance).

#### Egg falls in an arc according to the speed it was moving at the moment it was dropped (hard to see in an image, visible in the video and when running the program)
